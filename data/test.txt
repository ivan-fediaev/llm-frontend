Additionally, “classical” also connotes a description in which the effects of finite time-
dependency are ignored. In this sense, thermodynamics resembles the field of statics from
Newtonian mechanics. Recall Newton’s second law of motion, m d2
x/dt2
=
P
F, where m
is the mass, x is the position vector, t is time, and F is the force vector. In the statics limit
where
P
F = 0, inertial effects are ignored, as is time-dependency. Now, a Newtonian would
consider dynamics to imply motion, and so would consider thermodynamics to imply the
time-dependent motion of heat. So a Newtonian would be more inclined to call the subject
of these notes “thermostatics.” However, if we return to the earlier Greek translation of
dynamics as power, we are actually truer to the classical connotation of thermodynamics.
For the fundamental interplay of thermodynamics is that between so-called thermal energy
(as might be thought of when considering heat) and mechanical energy (as might be thought
of when considering power, a work rate). More formally, we will take the definition
• thermodynamics: the science that deals with heat and work and those properties of
matter that relate to heat and work.
One of the main goals of these notes will be to formalize the relationship between heat, work,
