1.1 Some semantics
We introduce here classical thermodynamics. The word “thermo-dynamic,” used first by
Thomson (later Lord Kelvin),1
has Greek origin, and is translated2
as the combination of
• θǫ́ρµη, therme: heat, and
• δύναµις, dynamis: power.
An image of Thomson and his 1849 first use of the word is given in Fig. 1.1.

The modifier “classical” is used to connote a description in which quantum mechanical
effects, the molecular nature of matter, and the statistical nature of molecular behavior

are not considered in any detail. These effects will not be completely ignored; however,
they will be lumped into simple averaged models that are valid on the macroscale. As an
example, for ordinary gases, our classical thermodynamics will be valid for systems whose
characteristic length scale is larger than the mean free path between molecular collisions.
For air at atmospheric density, this about 0.1 µm = 10−7
m).
Additionally, “classical” also connotes a description in which the effects of finite time-
dependency are ignored. In this sense, thermodynamics resembles the field of statics from
Newtonian mechanics. Recall Newton’s second law of motion, m d2
x/dt2
=
P
F, where m
is the mass, x is the position vector, t is time, and F is the force vector. In the statics limit
where
P
F = 0, inertial effects are ignored, as is time-dependency. Now, a Newtonian would
consider dynamics to imply motion, and so would consider thermodynamics to imply the
time-dependent motion of heat. So a Newtonian would be more inclined to call the subject
of these notes “thermostatics.” However, if we return to the earlier Greek translation of
dynamics as power, we are actually truer to the classical connotation of thermodynamics.
For the fundamental interplay of thermodynamics is that between so-called thermal energy
(as might be thought of when considering heat) and mechanical energy (as might be thought
of when considering power, a work rate). More formally, we will take the definition
• thermodynamics: the science that deals with heat and work and those properties of
matter that relate to heat and work.
One of the main goals of these notes will be to formalize the relationship between heat, work,
and energy.
We close this section by noting that the concept of energy has evolved through time, but
has ancient origins. The word itself had its first recorded use by Aristotle.3
His portrait,
along with an image of the relevant section of an 1818 translation of his treatise, is depicted in
Figs. 1.2. In the Greek, the word
,
ǫνǫ́ργǫια, “energeia,” connotes activity or operation. While
the word was known to Aristotle, its modern usage was not; it was the English polymath
Thomas Young who first used the word “energy,” consistent with any sort of modern usage,
in this case kinetic energy.4
A portrait of Young and an image of his text defining energy,
in actuality kinetic energy, in modern terms are shown in Fig. 1.3.

1.2 Historical milestones
Thermodynamics has a long history; unfortunately, it was not blessed with the crispness of
development that mechanics realized with Newton. In fact, its growth is filled with false
steps, errors, and debate that continues to this day. Truesdell6
and Müller7,8
summarize the
development in their idiosyncratic histories. Some of the milestones of its development are
given here:
• first century AD: Hero of Alexandria documents many early thermal engines.
• 1593: Galileo develops a water thermometer.
• 1650: Otto von Guericke designs and builds the first vacuum pump.
• 1662: Robert Boyle develops his law for isothermal ideal gases.

Strictly speaking, Newton did not consider the subject matter of thermodynamics. How-
ever, much of his work is concerned with energy. His theories are appropriate only for
mechanical energy. The notion that thermal energy existed and that it could be equivalent
to mechanical energy was not part of Newtonian mechanics. However, temperature was
known to Newton, as was Boyle’s law. When he tried to apply his theories to problems
of thermodynamics, such as calculation of the speed of sound in air, they notably failed.
This will be discussed at the conclusion of these notes in Ch. 9.8. The reason for the failure
required consideration of the yet-to-be-developed second law of thermodynamics.
1.3 Philosophy of science note
As with science in general, thermodynamics is based on empirical observation. Moreover, it
is important that those observations be repeatable. A few postulates, also known as axioms,
will serve as the foundation of our science. Following Occam’s razor,9
we shall seek as few
axioms as possible to describe this behavior. We will supplement these axioms with some
necessary definitions to describe nature. Then we shall use our reason to deduce from the
axioms and definitions certain theorems of engineering relevance.
This approach, that has its foundations in Aristotelian methods, is not unlike the ap-
proach taken by Euclid to geometry, Aquinas to theology, or Newton to mechanics. A

depiction of Euclid is given in Fig. 1.5. Consider for example that Euclid defined certain en-
tities such as points, lines, and planes, then adopted certain axioms such as parallel lines do
not meet at infinity, and went on to prove a variety of theorems. Classical thermodynamics
follows the same approach. Concepts such as system and process are defined, and axioms,
known as the laws of thermodynamics, are proposed in such a way that the minimum amount
of theory is able to explain the maximum amount of data.
Now, in some sense science can never be formally proved; it can only be disproved.
We retain our axioms as long as they are useful. When faced with empirical facts that
unambiguously contradict our axioms, we are required to throw away our axioms and develop
new ones. For example, in physics, the Michelson-Morley experiment forced Einstein to
abandon the axioms of Euclid, Newton, and Clausius for his theory of general relativity.
It turns out that we can still use these axioms, as long as we are considering problems in
which the speed of our reference frame is far less than the speed of light. In an example
from biology that is the topic of a popular science book,10
it was noted that it was once
believed that all swans were white. This working hypothesis was perfectly acceptable until
1697, when a black swan was discovered in Australia. Thus, the “theory” (though it is not
a highly profound theory) that all swans were white was unambiguously discredited. It will
be briefly seen in Ch. 6.10 that non-classical thermodynamics actually has a deep relation
to probability and statistics and information, a topic that transcends thermodynamics.
1.4 Some practical applications
It turns out that the classical approach to thermodynamics has had success in guiding the
engineering of devices. People have been building mechanical devices based on thermal

energy inputs for centuries, without the benefit of a cleanly enunciated theory. Famously,
Hero of Alexandria, perhaps the first recognized thermal engineer, documented a variety of
devices. These include an early steam engine11
known as the æolipile, pumps, and a device
to use fire to open doors. Hero and a nineteenth century rendition of his steam engine are
shown in Fig. 1.6. While Hero’s contributions are a matter of some speculation inspired by

some early ways to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy, and his æolipile; images
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero of Alexandria.
ancient artistry, the much later works of Denis Papin (1647-1712) are more certain. Papin
invented the so-called steam digester, that anticipated both the pressure cooker and the
steam engine. The device used steam power to lift a weight. Depictions of Papin and his
device are found in Fig. 1.7. Significant improvements were led by James Watt (1736-1819)
of Scotland. An image of Watt and one of his engines is shown in Fig. 1.8.

These engines were adopted for transportation. In 1807, the American engineer Robert
Fulton (1765-1815) was the first to use steam power in a commercial nautical vessel, the
Clermont, that was powered by a Boulton and Watt steam engine. Soon after, in 1811 in
Scotland, the first European commercial steam vessel, the Comet, embarked. We have a
sketch of the Comet and its steam power plant in Fig. 1.9. On land, steam power soon

engineer Robert Stephenson’s (1803-1859) Rocket, sketched in Fig. 1.10.

22 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
The effect of steam power, a contribution driven by engineers, on the development of
the world remains remarkable. It is what is commonly known as a disruptive technology as
its widespread adoption displaced other well-established technologies. While it is difficult to
quantify historical pronouncements, it is likely that the effect on the world was even more
profound than the introduction of networked computers in the late twentieth century. In
short, steam power was the linchpin for the industrial revolution. Steam power replaced
animal power as a prime mover throughout much of the world and, where implemented,
enabled rapid development of broad economic segments: mining, manufacturing, land and
sea transportation, among others. Large scale population movements ensued as opportunities
in urban manufacturing centers made industrial work more appealing than agricultural work.
Certainly, changes precipitated by the advent of steam power were contributing factors in
widespread social unrest in the nineteenth century, ranging from labor strife to war between
nation states.
Some more modern devices, listed here, are relevant to thermodynamics:
• simple steam power plant,
• fuel cells,
• vapor-compression refrigeration cycle,
• air separation plant,
• the gas turbine, and
• the chemical rocket engine.
As an example, the main power plant of the University of Notre Dame, depicted in Fig. 1.11,
is based on a steam power cycle that will be a topic of study in this course. Additionally,
one might consider the following topics to have thermodynamic relevance:
• gasoline and Diesel engines,
• the weather,
• cooking,
• heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&R), or
• materials processing (metals, polymers, etc.).

24 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
1.5 Example to illustrate homework solution style
Proper technical communication is important for engineering. Here is an example of how
one might construct a homework solution. We take an example involving mechanical energy
from introductory physics:
Example 1.1
A mass of m = 1 kg is initially at rest and is dropped from a height of y = yo = 10 m above the
ground, where gravitational acceleration g = 9.81 m/s2
. Neglect drag forces. Find the time to reach
the ground, the kinetic energy as a function of time, and the potential energy as a function of time.
Plot key results.
The scenario is sketched in Fig. 1.12. The principle governing the motion of the body is Newton’s

acting in the negative y direction. This gives the equation

where C1 is a constant. Integrate a second time to get

decreases, kinetic energy increases just as much, rendering the total mechanical energy to be constant.

28 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
When drag forces are included, we begin with the same amount of total mechanical energy and
potential energy. At the end of the calculation, we have the same amount of potential energy (zero), but
less kinetic energy and less total mechanical energy. Where did this energy go? In fact, it is transformed
into another form of energy, thermal energy, that is not accounted for in Newtonian mechanics. When
we properly account for thermal energy, we will again impose a conservation of total energy, one of the
main topics of this course, to be considered at the outset of Chapter 3.
We close this section with an image of Newton in Fig. 1.16, who began to study issues
related to thermodynamics, and whose scientific methods imbue its development.

1.6. THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEM AND CONTROL VOLUME 29
1.6 Thermodynamic system and control volume
We take the following definitions:
• Thermodynamic system: a quantity of fixed mass under investigation,
• Surroundings: everything external to the system,
• System boundary: interface separating system and surroundings, and
• Universe: combination of system and surroundings.
The system, surroundings, and system boundary for a universe are shown for a potato-
shaped system in Fig. 1.17. We allow two important interactions between the system and

its surroundings:
• heat can cross into the system (our potato can get hot), and
• work can cross out of the system (our potato can expand).
Now, the system boundaries can change, for example the potato might expand on heating,
but we can still distinguish the system and the surroundings. We now define an
• isolated system: a system that is not influenced by its surroundings.
Note that a potato with thick and inelastic skin will be isolated. We distinguish the system,
that has constant mass, but possible variable volume, from the

The control volume is bounded by the
• Control Surface: boundary of the control volume.
The mass within a control volume may or may not be constant. If there is fluid flow in
and out there may or may not be accumulation of mass within the control volume. We will
mainly study cases in which there is no accumulation, but this need not be the case. A
sketch contrasting scenarios in which a fluid is compressed in which the system approach
would be used against those where the control volume approach would be used is shown in

In principle, we could solve for the forces acting on every molecule and use Newton’s laws
to determine the behavior of systems. This is difficult for even modestly sized systems.
• If we had a volume of 1 m3
of gas at atmospheric pressure and temperature, we would
find that it was composed of 2.4 × 1025
molecules.
• We would need six equations of motion for each molecule, three for x, y, z, position,
and three for u, v, w, velocity. This would require then a total of 1.4 × 1026
differential
equations to solve simultaneously.

1.7. MACROSCOPIC VERSUS MICROSCOPIC 31
• Even with our largest computers, this is impossible today. Note most desktop com-
puters only can store roughly 109
bytes of data in Random Access Memory (RAM).
• We can however model the average behavior of the molecules statistically.
• We can also use simple empirical relations that can be formally proved to capture the
statistical nature of the flow. This will be our approach.
• classical thermodynamics will treat macroscopic effects only and ignore individual
molecular effects. For example molecules bouncing off a wall exchange momentum
with the wall and induce pressure. We could use Newtonian mechanics for each par-
ticle collision to calculate the net force on the wall. Instead our approach amounts to
considering the average over space and time of the net effect of millions of collisions on
a wall.
We will in fact assume that matter can be modeled as a
• Continuum: the limit in which discrete changes from molecule to molecule can be
ignored and distances and times over which we are concerned are much larger than
those of the molecular scale. This will enable the use of calculus in our continuum
thermodynamics.
The continuum theory can break down in important applications where the length and time
scales are of comparable magnitude to molecular time scales. Important applications where
the continuum assumption breaks down include
• rarefied gas dynamics of the outer atmosphere (relevant for low orbit space vehicles),
and
• nano-scale heat transfer (relevant in cooling of computer chips).
To get some idea of the scales involved, we note that for air at atmospheric pressure and
temperature that the time and distance between molecular collisions provide the limits of
the continuum. Under these conditions, we find for air
• length > 0.1 µm, and
• time > 0.1 ns,
will be sufficient to use the continuum assumption. For denser gases, these cutoff scales are
smaller. For lighter gases, these cutoff scales are larger. Details of collision theory can be
found in advanced texts such as that of Vincenti and Kruger.12
They show for air that the
mean free path λ is well modeled by the following equation:

1.8. PROPERTIES AND STATE OF A SUBSTANCE 33
1.8 Properties and state of a substance
We define
• Phase: a quantity of matter that is homogeneous throughout, and
• Phase Boundaries: interfaces between different phases.
An example of a single phase is ice. Another single phase is liquid water. A glass of ice
water is a two-phase mixture with the phase boundaries at the edge of each ice cube.
We next define (circularly)
• State: condition described by observable macroscopic properties, and
• Property: quantity that only depends on the state of the system and is independent
of the history of the system.
Examples of properties include temperature and pressure. Two states are equivalent if they
have the same properties. So if state 1 is defined by temperature T1 and pressure P1, and
state 2 is defined is by temperature T2 and P2, state 1 is equivalent to state 2 iff (that is, if
and only if) T1 = T2 and P1 = P2.
There are two important classes of properties we consider in thermodynamics:
• Extensive Property: a property that depends on the mass (or the extent) of the
system, example extensive properties include mass, total volume, total energy, and
• Intensive Property: a property that is independent of the mass of the system.
Example intensive properties include temperature and pressure.
In general, if you cut a system in half and re-measure its properties, intensive properties
remain unchanged, while extensive properties are cut in half. Properties are defined for
systems that are in
• Equilibrium: state in which no spontaneous changes are observed with respect to
time.
We actually never totally achieve equilibrium, we only approximate it. It takes infinite time
to achieve final equilibrium. In this class we will mainly be concerned with two types of
equilibrium:
• Mechanical equilibrium: characterized by equal pressure, and
• Thermal equilibrium: characterized by equal temperature.
CC BY-NC-ND. 02 March 2024, J. M. Powers.
34 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
A third type of equilibrium is chemical equilibrium, that we will not consider here, and is
characterized by equal chemical potentials.
A difficult conceptual challenge of thermodynamics is to reckon with two systems initially
at their own equilibria, to bring them into contact so that they find a new equilibria. How to
do this without consideration of time can be difficult. Another branch of thermodynamics,
that we will consider only briefly in this course is
• Non-equilibrium thermodynamics: branch of thermodynamics that considers sys-
tems often far from equilibrium and the time-dynamics of their path to equilibrium.
We will go to great effort to construct a thermodynamics that is generally not burdened
with time. Occasionally we will bring time into our problems. Unfortunately, ignoring time
occasionally requires some mental contortions, as seen in the next section.
1.9 Processes and cycles
Often systems undergo a
• Change of State: implies one or more properties of the system has changed.
How these properties would change outside of time is curiously outside the framework of
equilibrium thermodynamics! The best way to think of them is that the changes are slow
relative to the underlying molecular time scales. Fortunately, this will allow us to do a wide
variety of problems of engineering relevance.
We also define a
• Process: a succession of changes of state.
We assume our processes are all sufficiently slow such that each stage of the process is near
equilibrium. Certain common processes are given special names, based on the Greek
,
ι
′
σoς,
isos, meaning “equal”:
• isothermal: constant temperature,
• isobaric: constant pressure, and
• isochoric: constant volume.
An important notion in thermodynamics is that of a
• cycle: series of processes that returns to the original state.
The cycle is a thermodynamic “round trip.”

1.10. FUNDAMENTAL VARIABLES AND UNITS 35
1.10 Fundamental variables and units
We will mainly use the Système International (SI) units in this course. Occasionally, we
will use the English Engineering system of units. As found in US National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) documents, the important fundamental base SI units,
and corresponding English units are
• length:
– meter (m): the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time
interval of 1/299792458 of a second, and
– foot (ft),
• time:
– second: (s) the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to
the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium
133 atom, and
– second: (s) English time units are identical to those of SI,
• mass:
– kilogram (kg): until May 2019 was defined as a mass equal to the mass of the
international prototype of the kilogram (a platinum-iridium bar stored in Paris),
roughly equal to the mass of one liter of water at standard temperature and
pressure; its new definition is such that it is defined by taking the fixed numerical
value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015 × 10−34
when expressed in the
unit J s, that is equal to kg m2
s−1
, and
– pound mass: (lbm),
• temperature: an equilibrium property that roughly measures how hot or cold an
object is. Note our senses are poor judges of temperature. Consider snow and air in
thermal equilibrium at 20 ◦
F. Usually, it is possible to keep your bare hands warm for
many hours at 20 ◦
F if you are otherwise dressed warmly. However, if you place your
bare hand in a snow bank you for a few minutes, you have a danger of frostbite. Yet
both are at the same temperature. Why the difference in sense? Our bodies actually
have more sensitivity to heat fluxes instead of temperature; heat leaves our body more
rapidly when in contact with high density objects like snow relative to that of low
density objects like air. More fundamental than common units such as ◦
F are so-called
absolute temperature units:
– Kelvin: (K) until recently, the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic tem-
perature of the triple point of water, and since May 2019 defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant kB to be 1.380649 × 10−23
when
expressed in the unit J K−1
, that is equal to kg m2
s−2

1.11 Zeroth law of thermodynamics
In this class we are taking the axiomatic approach. Recall that an axiom cannot be proven.
It is a statement whose truth can be ascertained only by comparison with experiment.
The axiom can be disproved by a single negative experiment. The so-called zeroth law of
thermodynamics is the axiom that is probably most fundamental. It was formalized after
the so-called first and second laws, and so it is called the zeroth law. Perhaps if a more
fundamental axiom were discovered, it would be called the −1st
law of thermodynamics?
• Zeroth law of thermodynamics: When two bodies have equality of temperature
with a third body, then they have equality of temperature.
The origins of the zeroth law are murky. Sommerfeld13
attributes the notion to R. H. Fowler
in a 1931 review of a thermodynamics book. Fowler and Guggenheim explicitly introduce
the term “zeroth law of thermodynamics” later.14
The equivalent statement in mathematical
logic is that if x = y and x = z, then y = z; this is in fact equivalent to the first of Euclid’s
common notions: things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to each other.
Definition of the zeroth law enables the use of a thermometer as a measurement device.
A scale however needs to be defined. The old metric temperature scale, Celsius (◦
C), was
defined so that
• 0 ◦
C is the freezing point of water, and
• 100 ◦
C is the boiling point of water.
These quantities varied with pressure however, so that different values would be obtained on
top of a mountain versus down in the valley, and so this is not a good standard. Until May
2019, the Celsius scale was defined to be nearly the same, but had
• 0.01 ◦
C as the so-called triple point of water, and
• −273.15 ◦
C as absolute zero in K.
The triple point of water is defined at the state where three phases of water (solid, liquid,
and gas) are observed to co-exist. Now it is defined in terms of the Boltzmann constant on
a similar basis as the Kelvin scale, in such as way that the triple point of water remains,
within the limits of experimental error, at 0.01 ◦
C. The transformation between the absolute
Kelvin scale and the Celsius scale is given by
