Additionally, “classical” also connotes a description in which the effects of finite time-
dependency are ignored. In this sense, thermodynamics resembles the field of statics from
Newtonian mechanics. Recall Newton’s second law of motion, m d2
x/dt2
=
P
F, where m
is the mass, x is the position vector, t is time, and F is the force vector. In the statics limit
where
P
F = 0, inertial effects are ignored, as is time-dependency. Now, a Newtonian would
consider dynamics to imply motion, and so would consider thermodynamics to imply the
time-dependent motion of heat. So a Newtonian would be more inclined to call the subject
of these notes “thermostatics.” However, if we return to the earlier Greek translation of
dynamics as power, we are actually truer to the classical connotation of thermodynamics.
For the fundamental interplay of thermodynamics is that between so-called thermal energy
(as might be thought of when considering heat) and mechanical energy (as might be thought
of when considering power, a work rate). More formally, we will take the definition
• thermodynamics: the science that deals with heat and work and those properties of
matter that relate to heat and work.
One of the main goals of these notes will be to formalize the relationship between heat, work,
and energy.
We close this section by noting that the concept of energy has evolved through time, but
has ancient origins. The word itself had its first recorded use by Aristotle.3
His portrait,
along with an image of the relevant section of an 1818 translation of his treatise, is depicted in
Figs. 1.2. In the Greek, the word
,
ǫνǫ́ργǫια, “energeia,” connotes activity or operation. While
the word was known to Aristotle, its modern usage was not; it was the English polymath
Thomas Young who first used the word “energy,” consistent with any sort of modern usage,
in this case kinetic energy.4
A portrait of Young and an image of his text defining energy,
in actuality kinetic energy, in modern terms are shown in Fig. 1.3.

Finally, though she did not use the word “energy,” the notion of what is now known as
kinetic energy being related to the square of velocity was first advanced by du Châtelet,5

1.2 Historical milestones
Thermodynamics has a long history; unfortunately, it was not blessed with the crispness of
development that mechanics realized with Newton. In fact, its growth is filled with false
steps, errors, and debate that continues to this day. Truesdell
